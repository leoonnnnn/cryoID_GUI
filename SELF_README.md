#### note to self: 
All my other developmental code is in C:\Users\noelu\Python Projects\PyQt GUI practice\QtDesigner_practice\draftGUI. There's a bunch of examples and other junk in there. Copy what's needed to here and make the final touches here (edit: slightly cleaned up now, so edit it there and bring it over when done). And then maybe copy it back over to that clusterfuck folder (just make a new folder under backups with the date as the name).
