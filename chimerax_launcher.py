    ]

    # Check for ChimeraX executable in default locations
    #   just loops thru the default_locations list, simple solution
    #   Originally was going to use platform to first detect the operating system, but might be overkill, would need to store locations in a dictionary or use a switch statement
    #   Tho if used switch statements, could list various locations for each OS, like from more specific to broad locations like up to the whole file system. And then search in a while loop.
    #   One issue tho is have to include all operating system names. Prob would be fine for most cases: Linux, windows, Darwin (macOS). But users might have other OS's like Cygwin, Java, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, SunOS, etc.
    #   There's also 2 other ways of finding the OS: os.name, sys.platform (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4553129/when-to-use-os-name-sys-platform-or-platform-system)
    #       sys.platform allows you to do stuff like "if sys.platform.startswith('darwin'):"   Tho I think startswith might just be a default python string method
    #   Apparently the output of platform.system is determined at run time, while the other two are at compile time, so that'd matter if you're packaging and distributing your code as an executable.
